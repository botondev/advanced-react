# Advanced React.js by Samer Buna 2020 edition
## Re-worked by Botond Bertalan - botondev

Course name:
Advanced React.js
by Samer Buna

Here is the url for the course

https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/reactjs-advanced/description

The course originally was created in 2017 and as of 2020 the tooling used in the project is a little bit outdated.

I decided to re-create the course from scratch, so if you get stuck in the course, you can pull the project from this repo,
using the tags similar to what the course uses.

To fetch, see and pull the tags available use the following git commands:
```
git fetch && git fetch --tags
git tag
git checkout v.babel.7
```

Please use the repo from tag v.babel.7, since that is the branch with all the local dev dependencies set up correctly.
This works from v.2.3 second course list, 3. video.

Let me know if you have any questions.
